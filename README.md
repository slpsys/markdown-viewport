Markdown Viewport
=================

Mostly, I'm just dumping this here so it's off my laptop. ~25 lines of HTML and the Markdown converter from [Pagedown](code.google.com/p/pagedown/) that scratch an itch I had: our internal logging system previously loaded static HTML files, and I just wanted to convert the actual content to Markdown for ease of writing/reading. Documentation's now addressable from *root/viewport.html?relative/path/documentation.md*. It honestly took longer to write this readme, so I'm done writing it.
